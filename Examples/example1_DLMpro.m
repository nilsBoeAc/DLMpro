%% Object creation
offset = [-0.625,0,0];

%% Calc AIC with given red. frequencies and mach numbers
k = 0.1:0.1:1;      % reduced Frequency
ma = 0.1:0.1:0.6;  % mach Number

%% Adjust Method (Integration and Approximation)

%% Access results
dlm.resultOverview
% Result No: Number of Result
% k-M-List : Pair for which the AIC are calculated
% AIC      : Aerodynamic Influence Coefficients
% Qss      : Aerodyanmic Influence with respect to 2 DoF per panel (pitch and plunge) - in structure coordinate System
% Qkk      : Aerodyanmic Influence with respect to 2 DoF per panel (pitch and plunge) - in aero coordinate System
% other    : information on used methods

% Note: Since GSA (Transformation matrix between structural and aeor grid)
%       is not given, the size and values of Qss and Qkk are equal.
