function Dnew = symmetry(obj,D)  
% symmetry calculates a new influence coefficients matrix due to symmetry effects
%% Description:
%   Symmetry is used to calculate a new influence coefficients matrix
%   that is used to determine the aerodynamic influence coefficients.
%   This is needed to consider symmetry effects and the influences from one
%   wing to another if only one wing shall be analyzed.
%   
%% Syntax:
%   Dnew = symmetry(obj,D);
%
%% Input:
%   Required input variables:
%     D: influence coefficients matrx
%   
%% Output:
%   Dnew: new influence coefficients matrix considered of symmetry effects
