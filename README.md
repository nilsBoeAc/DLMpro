# dlmpro
## Description
   This class set up a Doublet-Lattice-Model for a given Wing
   Several Methods are provided for calculating the Aerodyanmic
   Influence Coefficients

   Constructor:
       self = DLMPro(Span,Chord,NS,NC,Sweep,Dihedral,TR)

   Methods:
       res = self.calcAIC(kVect,machVect)

   This Tool will be updated continualy with further modules. (e.g. to
   visualize the results, etc.)


   For more detailed Information on methods see Documentation 
    -> "supplemental Software"

## Examples
    -> Examples can be found in the "Example_Folder"
