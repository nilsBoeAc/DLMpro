## Description
   This class sets up a Doublet-Lattice-Model for a given Wing.
   Several Methods are provided for calculating the Aerodyanmic
   Influence Coefficients (AIC)

   All Calculations are performed in MATALB.

   For more detailed Information on methods see Documentation -> see "supplemental Software"

## Examples
   - Examples can be found in the "Example_Folder" 

## Limitations
   - Non-Planar configuations do not work
   - Optimised for available definition of the wing

## To-Do's:
   - more detailed description of the wing in form of sections and regions
   - non-planar configurations
   - surface-body interactions

## IMPORTANT NOTE
   - This tool is currently under development and is therefore purely experimental!
   - It is tested and validated against various models calculated with NX NASTRAN,
     however errors cannot be excluded
